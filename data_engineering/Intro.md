Data engineers focuses on:

- building and maintaining data pipelines that transport data through different steps and put it into a usable state

The data engineering process encompasses the overall effort required to create data pipelines that automate the transfer of data from place to place and transform that data into a specific format for a certain type of analysis.

It's an ongoing practice that involves collecting, preparing, transforming, and delivering data. A data pipeline helps automate these tasks so they can be reliably repeated.

Welcome to my learning repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my journey as a post bootcamp software engineer. You will find a collection of notes, code snippets, oppsie/fixes, and reflections as I continue to grow as a developer.

## Challenges

Documenting the challenges I encounter and the solutions I discover is an essential part of my learning process. Check the [challenges](./challenges/) folder for detailed insights.

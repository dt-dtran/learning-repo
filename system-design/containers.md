# Containers

Containers are an application-centric method to deliver high-performing, scalable applications on any infrastructure of your choice. Containers are best suited to deliver microservices by providing portable, isolated virtual environments for applications to run without interference from other running applications.

- Containers encapsulate microservices and their dependencies but do not run them directly. Containers run container images.
- A **container image** bundles the application along with its runtime, libraries, and dependencies, and it represents the source of a container deployed to offer an isolated executable environment for the application.
- Container orchestrators are tools which group systems together to form clusters where containers' deployment and management is automated at scale
- Requirements: fault-tolerance, on-deman scalability, optimal resource usage, auto-discovery to automatically discover and communicate with each other, accessibility from the outside world, seamless updates / rollback without any downtime

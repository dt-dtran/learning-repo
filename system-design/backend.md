# Backend Architecture

Backend Architecture is a representation of the components and subcomponents that reflects the behavior of the system and / or backbone of web application. It handles the logic, data, and communication between client and server.

## Microservice

Microservices can be deployed individually on separate servers provisioned with fewer resources - only what is required by each service and the host system itself, helping to lower compute resource expenses.

Microservices-based architecture is aligned with Event-driven Architecture and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles, where complex applications are composed of small independent processes which communicate with each other through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) over a network. APIs allow access by other internal services of the same application or external, third-party services and applications.

The distributed nature of microservices adds complexity to the architecture.
Benefits of microservices:

- scalability: With the overall application becoming modular, each microservice can be scaled individually, either manually or automated through demand-based autoscaling.
- Seamless upgrades and patching processes: There is virtually no downtime and no service disruption to clients because upgrades are rolled out seamlessly - one service at a time, rather than having to recompile, rebuild and restart an entire monolithic application.
- productive and cost-effective: businesses are able to develop and roll-out new features and updates a lot faster, in an agile approach, having separate teams focusing on separate feature
